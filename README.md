## A short Description :
  
Our project is Hostel Buddy, a one stop destination to all your hostel needs.
Now we know, settling for the first time in a hostel wasn't the easiest job.
It has been noted that often the prices tend to go very high inside campuses with the inconvenience of having to carry items for long distances.
Enter Hostel Buddy.
The main aim is to conveniently provide the students with utilities at ideal prices. The purchasing process will be seamless and hasslefree.

## Few statistics:

- Most of the universities often sell products at a 43% higher cost than what is sold outside the campus.
- More than 90% of people buy exaggerated prices for items like mattresses due to inconvenience posed by logistics.
- Almost all the sick students need to walk to the dispensaries and medical shops located far from the hostel blocks for buying the medicines .
